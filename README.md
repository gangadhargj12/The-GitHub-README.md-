Data-Driven Marketing Analysis for Small Businesses
# Portfolio: Marketing ROI Analysis for Small Businesses (Capstone)
**By: Gangadhar GJ | MS in IT Management Candidate (IWU)**

### 💡 The "Why" Behind This Project
Coming from a Civil Engineering background, I’ve always been obsessed with how systems work. When I started my MS in IT Management at Indiana Wesleyan University, I wanted to apply that "systems thinking" to data. 

I noticed that many small businesses in the Irving/Dallas area have plenty of data but no time to look at it. My Capstone project was born from a simple question: **"Is this business actually making money from its marketing, or just spending it?"**

### 🛠 What I Built
I didn't just make charts; I built a mini-pipeline to clean and interpret messy customer data:
- **Data Cleanup:** I took raw, "dirty" Excel logs and used SQL to normalize them into a usable relational format.
- **Deep Dive:** I focused on **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**. I wanted to see which customers kept coming back and which ones were just one-time clicks.
- **Visualization:** I built a Tableau dashboard that a business owner could look at for 30 seconds and know exactly where to put their next $1,000.

### 📈 What I Found (The Results)
* **The "Email" Surprise:** While everyone was focused on Instagram ads, the data showed that Email subscribers had a 40% higher retention rate.
* **Wasted Spend:** I found a specific ad campaign that was bringing in "bots" rather than buyers, saving a potential $400/month if cut.
* **The Ethical Angle:** Following my IWU training, I ensured all customer data was anonymized to protect privacy while still providing business value.
